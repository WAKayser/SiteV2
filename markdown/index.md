I am Wouter Kayser and I am mainly a Electrical Engineering Student. During my studies my interests mostly go towards Wireless Communications. 

When I am not studying I am mostly helping out in various committees, giving advise to my successors, programming small projects or hanging out with my roommates. 

Check out my experiences and education under my CV, or what I am currently working at my Now page or read up on past projects.

If you are just looking for a book recommendation then I recommend the entire Discworld series. Which all are wonderful and have great humor. Personally I find Going Postal one of the best in the series, but that is probably because it is so closely aligned to my studies.
