## Course Summaries

During my master studies, I found it to be beneficial to make summaries of the courses I was following. I started doing this in plain text files, however this changed quickly to markdown as this can be styled in various ways. In the end I settled for using XeLaTeX and a customized template to create nice PDFs. After a while I found out I had enough pages to create a book out of it. Which will be posted here soon.  

## Personal Homepage

During the customization of my summaries I learned about the powers of Pandoc. This inspired me to create a fully static website, without any javascript. All pages are generated from markdown documents and some simple template files. The sources for my current website can by found on [my Github](https://github.com/Werser).
